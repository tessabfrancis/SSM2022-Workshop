# SSM2022-Workshop
Materials from the workshop, "Assessment approaches to support bycatch management for marine mammals" at the SMM2022 Conference

A pre-conference workshop was presented at the 24th Biennial Conference on the Biology of Marine Mammals in Palm Beach, Florida, USA, on July 31, 2022.

Workshop description:
Managers tasked with understanding, quantifying and mitigating marine mammalâ€“fishery interactions will often be starting with little or no data and with no system in place to collect data. The aims of this workshop are to increase the number of marine mammal populations for which abundance and bycatch can be estimated and to help identify which fisheries are most urgently in need of mitigation. We will provide a series of tutorials to aid in assessing marine mammals subject to bycatch, for example around estimating marine mammal population abundance and bycatch; assessing bycatch impacts relative to management or conservation references points; and a ShinyApp tool for conducting population projections under different bycatch mortality levels and calculating the parameters for Potential Biological Removal (PBR).

This repository contains the following materials from the workshop:
